# Textmining_NPA-reports

This repository provides all the code associated with the Master Thesis "Predicting cognitive tests scores for patients with primary braintumors by using sentence
embedding on neuropsychologistsâ€™reports", authored by Niek Huijsmans for the partial fulfillment of the requirements for the joint UvA-VU degree of Master of 
Science in Bioinformatics and Systems Biology. Both R code and Python3 code can be found. Results might 
differ a bit compared to those reported in the thesis, due to updated packages.
